Coding Challenge for Taller Interview

## Considerations

I created the app in 40 minutes, I just implemented what is needed because of the time

I can enrich the application with colors, UX, accesibility and so on, but that will take extra time

I could also add: SubscriptionHandler to unsubscribe, replace RxJS with Signals

add WCAG semantics, microdata for search engines, and so on. But again, this is a minimal black & white 

implementation that works

The app is responsive and fullfills the challenge requests

Used RxJS async Pipe for automatic subscription management.

Used debounceTime() operator in search event to prevent excessive API calls.

Used lightweight SCSS styles ensure optimized rendering, without third-party dependencies, such as Tailwind or Bootstrap.

Applied SOLID Principles: Separation of concerns between components and services.
